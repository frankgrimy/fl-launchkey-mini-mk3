> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

 1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

     Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

	 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy the original work/works and change the name; or obfuscate parts of, or the entire original work itself to make it look like it is a different work.  
	 1b. Profiting with the unmodified original with no work done over it what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.  
     Acceptable modified copies of the original work must provide new features and/or even remove existing ones.  
	 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.  
     1.d Abusing the terms this license establishes and harming the licensor or any other person in any ugly and/or unexpected way makes you a MOTHERFUCKING dick.

 2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
 share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's 
 creator(s) a pint.
 
 3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes 
 you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick gigachad user would submit the fix back or submit a [bug report](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html).

 4. If you use code, calling it your own would make you a ROYAL dick. [How to cite a repo](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/14010/how-do-you-cite-a-github-repository). Alternatively, even just a comment giving attribution to where you found the code would be OK.
 
 
 5. The licensor has the right to modify or change this license in case of (but is not limited to):  
	 6a. A contradiction between these terms is found.  
     6b. Some MOTHERFUCKING dick is abusing these terms (as stated in 1.d).
 If some licensee is being affected negatively by this license, the licensee can ask the licensor for license modifications.  
 Even if the request is reasonable, the licensor can choose to modify the license or not.  
 In case of the last one, then the licensor is a LAZY ASS dick, but no liability is applicable under any circumstance.  

 6. You can change or remove this license for your modified copy of this work as long as your copy complies with the conditions this license states.
 If not, then that copy will still be covered by this license.
